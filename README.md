This React-on-Rails application utilizes the OpenChargeMap API to retrieve data about which charging stations are in which cities.
Through utilizing CSS frameworks such as Materialize and Bootstrap, I was able to create a simple and geometric design for this application.
Both frameworks were molded so that they do not appear to be from their respective origins and I wanted to show how even some of the most popular frameworks can be customized.

To show my versatility across platforms, I also built a compatible app using Alexa, AWS, and Amazon Lambda services.
##Resources Used
Bootstrap
Materialize
Ruby on Rails
React
